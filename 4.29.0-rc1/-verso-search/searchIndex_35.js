In this case, the binding in question can be replaced with a standard\npattern-matching let.\n\nOne common cause of this error is that a pattern that was intended to match a constructor was\ninstead interpreted as a variable binding. This occurs, for instance, if a constructor\nname (e.g., cons) is written without its prefix (List) outside of that type's namespace.\nThe constructor-name-as-variable linter, enabled by default, will display a warning on any variable\npatterns that resemble constructor names.\n\nThis error nearly always indicates an issue with the code where it appears.

the conclusion is a type.\nAssumptions are either arbitrary elements of some type or statements that are presumed true.\n\nAssumption Names and ConclusionThis goal has four assumptions:case cons\nα : Type ?u.317\nx : α\nxs : List α\nih : xs ++ [] = xs\n⊢ x :: xs ++ [] = x :: xsThey are:* α, an arbitrary type* x, an arbitrary α* xs, an arbitrary List α* ih, an induction hypothesis that asserts that appending the empty list to xs is equal to xs.The conclusion is the statement that prepending x to both sides of the equality in the induction hypothesis results in equal lists.\n\nSome assumptions are inaccessible,   which means that they cannot be referred to explicitly by name.\nInaccessible assumptions occur when an assumption is created without a specified name or when the assumption's name is shadowed by a later assumption.\nInaccessible assumptions should be regarded as anonymous; they are presented as if they had names because they may be referred to in later assumptions or in the conclusion, and displaying a name allows these references to be distinguished from one another.\nIn particular, inaccessible assumptions are presented with daggers (†) after their names.\n\nAccessible Assumption NamesIn this proof state, all assumptions are accessible.case bind_pure_comp\nα β : Type ?u.470\nf : α → β\nx : Option α\n⊢ (do\n      let a ← x\n      pure (f a)) =\n    f <$> x\n\nInaccessible Assumption NamesIn this proof state, only the first and third assumptions are accessible.\nThe second and fourth are inaccessible, and their names include a dagger to indicate that they cannot be referenced.case bind_pure_comp\nα β✝ : Type ?u.579\nf : α → β✝\nx✝ : Option α\n⊢ (do\n      let a ← x✝\n      pure (f a)) =\n    f <$> x✝\n\nInaccessible assumptions can still be used.\nTactics such as assumption or simp can scan the entire list of assumptions, finding one that is useful, and contradiction can eliminate the current goal by finding an impossible assumption without naming it.\nOther tactics, such as rename_i and next, can be used to name inaccessible assumptions, making them accessible.\nAdditionally, assumptions can be referred to by their type, by writing the type in single guillemets.\n\nAssumptions by TypeSingle guillemets around a term represent a reference to some term in scope with that type.This can be used to refer to local lemmas by their theorem statement rather than by name, or to refer to assumptions regardless of whether they have explicit names.\n\nAssumptions by TypeIn the following proof, cases is repeatedly used to analyze a number.\nAt the beginning of the proof, the number is named x, but cases generates an inaccessible name for subsequent numbers.\nRather than providing names, the proof takes advantage of the fact that there is a single assumption of type Nat at any given time and uses ‹Nat› to refer to it.\nAfter the iteration, there is an assumption that n + 3 < 3, which contradiction can use to remove the goal from consideration.example : x < 3 → x ∈ [0, 1, 2] := by\n  intros\n  iterate 3\n    cases ‹Nat›\n    . decide\n  contradiction\n\n\nAssumptions by Type, Outside ProofsSingle-guillemet syntax also works outside of proofs:#eval\n  let x := 1\n  let y := 2\n  ‹Nat›\n2\nThis is generally not a good idea for non-propositions, however—when it matters which element of a type is selected, it's better to select it explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\n","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Tactic Proofs","header":"14.2.
