This fixes\nhttps://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/10749. With set_option backwards.match.rowMajor false the old behavior can be turned on.* #10823 lets the match compilation procedure use sparse case analysis\nwhen the patterns only match on some but not all constructors of an\ninductive type. This way, less code is produce. Before, code handling\neach of the other cases was then optimized and commoned-up by later\ncompilation pipeline, but that is wasteful to do.* #10826 fixes the location of the “deprecated constant” and similar\nerror messages on field notation (e.f, (e).f, e |>. f). Fixes\n#10821.* #10851 lets match compilation use exfalso as soon as no alternatives\nare left. This way, the compiler does not have to look at subsequent\ncase splits.* #10865 makes the spec Std.Do.Spec.forIn'_list and friends more\nuniverse polymorphic.* #10872 improves the performance of mvcgen by an optimized\nimplementation for try (mpure_intro; trivial). This tactic sequence is\nused to eagerly discharge VCs and in the process instantiates schematic\nvariables.* #10926 topologically sorts abstracted vars in\nMeta.Closure.mkValueTypeClosure if MVars are being abstracted.\nFixes #10705* #10931 strips the Expr.mdata that WF.Fix uses to associate goal\nwith recursive calls from the goal presented to the tactics.\nFixes #10895.* #10944 runs enableRealizationsForConst on sizeOf declarations. Fixes\n#10573.* #10980 tries to preserve names of pattern variables in match\nalternatives in decreasing_by, by telescoping into the concrete\nalternative rather than the type of the matcher's alt. Fixes #10976.* #11011 extracts some refactorings from #10763, including dropping dead\ncode and not failing in inaccessibleAsCtor, which leadas to (slightly)\nbetter error messages, and also on the grounds that the failing\nalternative may actually be unreachable.* #11024 lets Bool have .ctorIdx like any other inductive.* #11068 removes the verifyEnum functions from the bv_decide frontend.\nThese functions looked at the implementation of matchers to see if they\nreally do the matching that they claim to do. This breaks that\nabstraction barrier, and should not be necessary, as only functions with\na MatcherInfo env entry are considered here, which should all play\nnicely.* #11072 adds “sparse casesOn” constructions. They are similar to\n.casesOn, but have arms only for some constructors and a catch-all\n(providing t.ctorIdx ≠ 42 assumptions). The compiler has native\nsupport for these constructors and now (because of the similarity) also\nthe per-constructor elimination principles.* #11094 makes workspaceSymbol benchmarks modules, so that they are\nless sensitive to additions of private symbols in the standard library.* #11095 makes use of hasIndepIndices. That function was unused since\ncommit 54f6517ca36b237b40e02aac62ea36dbd4179758, but it seems it should\nbe used.* #11107 tests the missing cases error.* #11122 fixes a problem for structures with diamond inheritance: rather\nthan copying doc-strings (which are not available unless .server.olean\nis loaded), we link to them. Adds tests.* #11125 adds a filter for premise selectors to ensure deprecated\ntheorems are not returned.* #11132 adds support for grind +suggestions and simp_all? +suggestions in try?. It outputs grind only [X, Y, Z] or simp_all only [X, Y, Z] suggestions (rather than just +suggestions).* #11146 fixes a bug in #11125. Added a test this time ...* #11150 adds a new, inactive and unused doElem_elab attribute that\nwill allow users to register custom elaborators for doElems in the\nform of the new type DoElab. The old do elaborator is active by\ndefault but can be switched off by disabling the new option\nbackward.do.legacy.* #11161 adds getEntry/getEntry?/getEntry!/getEntryD operation on\nDTreeMap.* #11184 modifies the error message that is returned when more than one\nsynthetic metavariable can't be resolved.* #11190 avoids running into an “unknown free variable” when printing the\n“Failed to compile pattern matching” error. Fixes #11186.* #11191 makes sure that inside a realizeConst the maxHeartbeat\noption is effective.\n\n","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Release Notes\u0009Lean 4.26.0-rc1 (2025-11-19)","header":"Language","id":"/releases/v4.26.0/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___26___0-rc1-_LPAR_2025-11-19_RPAR_--Language"}});
