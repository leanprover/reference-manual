Lean includes a number of built-in types that are specially supported by the compiler.
Some, such as {lean}`Nat`, additionally have special support in the kernel.
Other types don't have special compiler support _per se_, but rely in important ways on the internal representation of types for performance reasons.

# The Unit Type

The unit type is the canonical type with exactly one element, named {name Unit.unit}`unit` and represented by the empty tuple {lean}`()`.
It describes only a single value, which consists of said constructor applied to no arguments whatsoever.

{lean}`Unit` is analogous to `void` in languages derived from C: even though `void` has no elements that can be named, it represents the return of control flow from a function with no additional information.
In functional programming, {lean}`Unit` is the return type of things that "return nothing".
Mathematically, this is represented by a single completely uninformative value, as opposed to an empty type such as {lean}`Empty`, which represents unreachable code.

:::leanSection
```lean (show := false)
variable {m : Type → Type} [Monad m] {α : Type}
```

When programming with {ref "monads-and-do"}[monads], {lean}`Unit` is especially useful.
For any type {lean}`α`, {lean}`m α` represents an action that has side effects and returns a value of type {lean}`α`.
The type {lean}`m Unit` represents an action that has some side effects but does not return a value.

:::



There are two variants of the unit type:

 * {lean}`Unit` is a {lean}`Type` that exists in the smallest non-propositional {tech}[universe].

 * {lean}`PUnit` is {tech key:="universe polymorphism"}[universe polymorphic] and can be used in any non-propositional {tech}[universe].

Behind the scenes, {lean}`Unit` is actually defined as {lean}`PUnit.{1}`.
{lean}`Unit` should be preferred over {name}`PUnit` when possible to avoid unnecessary universe parameters.
If in doubt, use {lean}`Unit` until universe errors occur.

## Definitional Equality

{deftech}_Unit-like types_ are inductive types that have a single constructor which takes no non-proof parameters.
{lean}`PUnit` is one such type.
All elements of unit-like types are {tech key:="definitional equality"}[definitionally equal] to all other elements.

:::example "Definitional Equality of {lean}`Unit`"
Every term with type {lean}`Unit` is definitionally equal to every other term with type {lean}`Unit`:

```lean
example (e1 e2 : Unit) : e1 = e2 := rfl
```
:::

::::keepEnv
:::example "Definitional Equality of Unit-Like Types"

Both {lean}`CustomUnit` and {lean}`AlsoUnit` are unit-like types, with a single constructor that takes no parameters.
Every pair of terms with either type is definitionally equal.

```lean
inductive CustomUnit where
  | customUnit

example (e1 e2 : CustomUnit) : e1 = e2 := rfl

structure AlsoUnit where

example (e1 e2 : AlsoUnit) : e1 = e2 := rfl
```

Types with parameters, such as {lean}`WithParam`, are also unit-like if they have a single constructor that does not take parameters.

```lean
inductive WithParam (n : Nat) where
  | mk

example (x y : WithParam 3) : x = y := rfl
```

Constructors with non-proof parameters are not unit-like, even if the parameters are all unit-like types.
```lean
inductive NotUnitLike where
  | mk (u : Unit)
```

```lean (error:=true) (name := NotUnitLike)
example (e1 e2 : NotUnitLike) : e1 = e2 := rfl
```
```leanOutput NotUnitLike
type mismatch
  rfl
has type
  ?m.13 = ?m.13 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  e1 = e2 : Prop
```

Constructors of unit-like types may take parameters that are proofs.
```lean
inductive ProofUnitLike where
  | mk : 2 = 2 → ProofUnitLike

example (e1 e2 : ProofUnitLike) : e1 = e2 := rfl
```

# Booleans

{docstring Bool}

The constructors {lean}`Bool.true` and {lean}`Bool.false` are exported from the {lean}`Bool` namespace, so they can be written {lean}`true` and {lean}`false`.

## Run-Time Representation

Because {lean}`Bool` is an {tech}[enum inductive] type, it is represented by a single byte in compiled code.

## Booleans and Propositions

Both {lean}`Bool` and {lean}`Prop` represent notions of truth.
From a purely logical perspective, they are equivalent: {tech}[propositional extensionality] means that there are fundamentally only two propositions, namely {lean}`True` and {lean}`False`.
However, there is an important pragmatic difference: {lean}`Bool` classifies _values_ that can be computed by programs, while {lean}`Prop` classifies statements for which code generation doesn't make sense.
In other words, {lean}`Bool` is the notion of truth and falsehood that's appropriate for programs, while {lean}`Prop` is the notion that's appropriate for mathematics.
Because proofs are erased from compiled programs, keeping {lean}`Bool` and {lean}`Prop` distinct makes it clear which parts of a Lean file are intended for computation.

```lean (show := false)
section BoolProp

axiom b : Bool

/-- info: b = true : Prop -/
#guard_msgs in
#check (b : Prop)

example : (true = true) = True := by simp

#check decide
```

A {lean}`Bool` can be used wherever a {lean}`Prop` is expected.
There is a {tech}[coercion] from every {lean}`Bool` {lean}`b` to the proposition {lean}`b = true`.
By {lean}`propext`, {lean}`true = true` is equal to {lean}`True`, and {lean}`false = true` is equal to {lean}`False`.

Not every proposition can be used by programs to make run-time decisions.
Otherwise, a program could branch on whether the Collatz conjecture is true or false!
Many propositions, however, can be checked algorithmically.
These propositions are called {tech}_decidable_ propositions, and have instances of the {lean}`Decidable` type class.
The function {name}`Decidable.decide` converts a proof-carrying {lean}`Decidable` result into a {lean}`Bool`.
This function is also a coercion from decidable propositions to {lean}`Bool`, so {lean}`(2 = 2 : Bool)` evaluates to {lean}`true`.

```lean (show := false)
/-- info: true -/
#guard_msgs in
#eval (2 = 2 : Bool)
end BoolProp
```

## Syntax

:::syntax term (title := "Boolean Infix Operators")
The infix operators `&&`, `||`, and `^^` are notations for {lean}`Bool.and`, {lean}`Bool.or`, and {lean}`Bool.xor`, respectively.

```grammar
$_:term && $_:term
```
```grammar
$_:term || $_:term
```
```grammar
$_:term ^^ $_:term
```
:::

:::syntax term (title := "Boolean Negation")
The prefix operator `!` is notation for {lean}`Bool.not`.
```grammar
!$_:term
```

## API Reference

### Logical Operations

```lean (show := false)
section ShortCircuit

axiom BIG_EXPENSIVE_COMPUTATION : Bool
```

The functions {name}`cond`, {name Bool.and}`and`, and {name Bool.or}`or` are short-circuiting.
In other words, {lean}`false && BIG_EXPENSIVE_COMPUTATION` does not need to execute {lean}`BIG_EXPENSIVE_COMPUTATION` before returning `false`.
These functions are defined using the {attr}`macro_inline` attribute, which causes the compiler to replace calls to them with their definitions while generating code, and the definitions use nested pattern matching to achieve the short-circuiting behavior.

```lean (show := false)
end ShortCircuit
```
