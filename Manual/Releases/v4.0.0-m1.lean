The Lean development team is proud to announce the first milestone release of Lean 4. This release is aimed at experimentation with the new features of Lean 4, eventually leading to a full release of 4.0.0 ready for general use.

This release is the result of almost three years of work since the release of Lean 3.4.0, reworking, extending, and improving almost all aspects of Lean. More information about Lean 4 can be found in the [official documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/) as well as in the introductory talk ["An overview of Lean 4"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeGvhfW1v9M) at Lean Together 2021.
