#doc (Manual) "Interacting with Lean" =>
%%%
htmlSplit := .never
tag := "interaction"
%%%

Lean is designed for interactive use, rather than as a batch-mode system in which whole files are fed in and then translated to either object code or error messages.
Many programming languages designed for interactive use provide a {deftech}[REPL],{margin}[Short for {noVale "Vale can't handle partly-bolded words"}[“*R*ead-*E*val-*P*rint *L*oop”], because code is parsed (“read”), evaluated, and the result displayed, with this process repeated as many times as desired.] at which code can be input and tested, along with commands for loading source files, type checking terms, or querying the environment.
Lean's interactive features are based on a different paradigm.
Rather than a separate command prompt outside of the program, Lean provides {tech}[commands] for accomplishing the same tasks in the context of a source file.
By convention, commands that are intended for interactive use rather than as part of a durable code artifact are prefixed with {keyword}`#`.

Information from Lean commands is available in the {deftech}_message log_, which accumulates output from the {tech}[elaborator].
Each entry in the message log is associated with a specific source range and has a {deftech}_severity_.
There are three severities: {lean type:="Lean.MessageSeverity"}`information` is used for messages that do not indicate a problem, {lean type:="Lean.MessageSeverity"}`warning` indicates a potential problem, and {lean type:="Lean.MessageSeverity"}`error` indicates a definite problem.
For interactive commands, results are typically returned as informational messages that are associated with the command's leading keyword.

# Evaluating Terms
%%%
tag := "hash-eval"
%%%

The {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` command is used to run code as a program.
In particular, it is capable of executing {lean}`IO` actions, it uses a call-by-value evaluation strategy, {ref "partial-unsafe"}[{keyword}`partial` functions are executed], and both types and proofs are erased.
Use {keywordOf Lean.reduceCmd}`#reduce` to instead reduce terms using the reduction rules that are part of {tech}[definitional equality].

:::syntax command (title := "Evaluating Terms")

```grammar
#eval $t
```

```grammar
#eval! $t
```

{includeDocstring Lean.Parser.Command.eval}

:::

{keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` always {tech key:="elaborator"}[elaborates] and compiles the provided term.
It then checks whether the term transitively depends on any uses of {lean}`sorry`, in which case evaluation is terminated unless the command was invoked as {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval!`.
This is because compiled code may rely on compile-time invariants (such as array lookups being in-bounds) that are ensured by proofs of suitable statements, and running code that contains incomplete proofs (or uses of {lean}`sorry` that “prove” incorrect statements) can cause Lean itself to crash.

```lean (show := false)
section
variable (m : Type → Type)
open Lean.Elab.Command (CommandElabM)
```

:::paragraph

The way the code is run depends on its type:

 * If the type is in the {lean}`IO` monad, then it is executed in a context where {tech}[standard output] and {tech}[standard error] are captured and redirected to the Lean {tech}[message log].
   If the returned value's type is not {lean}`Unit`, then it is displayed as if it were the result of a non-monadic expression.
 * If the type is in one of the internal Lean metaprogramming monads ({name Lean.Elab.Command.CommandElabM}`CommandElabM`, {name Lean.Elab.Term.TermElabM}`TermElabM`, {name Lean.MetaM}`MetaM`, or {name Lean.CoreM}`CoreM`), then it is run in the current context.
    For example, the environment will contain the definitions that are in scope where {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` is invoked.
    As with {name}`IO`, the resulting value is displayed as if it were the result of a non-monadic expression.
    When Lean is running under {ref "lake"}[Lake], its working directory (and thus the working directory for {name}`IO` actions) is the current {tech}`workspace`.
 * If the type is in some other monad {lean}`m`, and there is a {lean}`MonadLiftT m CommandElabM` or {lean}`MonadEvalT m CommandElabM` instance, then {name}`MonadLiftT.monadLift` or {name}`MonadEvalT.monadEval` is used to transform the monad into one that may be run with {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval`, after which it is run as usual.
 * If the term's type is not in any of the supported monads, then it is treated as a pure value.
  The compiled code is run, and the result is displayed.

Auxiliary definitions or other environment modifications that result from elaborating the term in {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` are discarded.
If the term is an action in a metaprogramming monad, then changes made to the environment by the running the monadic action are preserved.
:::

```lean (show := false)
end
```

Results are displayed using a {name Lean.ToExpr}`ToExpr`, {name}`ToString`, or {name}`Repr` instance, if they exist.
If not, and {option}`eval.derive.repr` is {lean}`true`, Lean attempts to derive a suitable {name}`Repr` instance.
It is an error if no suitable instance can be found or derived.
Setting {option}`eval.pp` to {lean}`false` disables the use of {name Lean.ToExpr}`ToExpr` instances by {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval`.

:::example "Displaying Output"

{keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` cannot display functions:
```lean (name := funEval) (error := true)
#eval fun x => x + 1
```
```leanOutput funEval
could not synthesize a 'ToExpr', 'Repr', or 'ToString' instance for type
  Nat → Nat
```

It is capable of deriving instances to display output that has no {name}`ToString` or {name}`Repr` instance:

```lean (name := quadEval)
inductive Quadrant where
  | nw | sw | se | ne

#eval Quadrant.nw
```
```leanOutput quadEval
Quadrant.nw
```

The derived instance is not saved.
Disabling {option}`eval.derive.repr` causes {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` to fail:

```lean (name := quadEval2) (error := true)
set_option eval.derive.repr false
#eval Quadrant.nw
```
```leanOutput quadEval2
could not synthesize a 'ToExpr', 'Repr', or 'ToString' instance for type
  Quadrant
```

:::

{optionDocs eval.pp}

{optionDocs eval.type}

{optionDocs eval.derive.repr}

Monads can be given the ability to execute in {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` by defining a suitable {lean}`MonadLift`{margin}[{lean}`MonadLift` is described in {ref "lifting-monads"}[the section on lifting monads.]] or {lean}`MonadEval` instance.
Just as {name}`MonadLiftT` is the transitive closure of {name}`MonadLift` instances, {name}`MonadEvalT` is the transitive closure of {name}`MonadEval` instances.
As with {name}`MonadLiftT` users should not define additional instances of {name}`MonadEvalT` directly.

# Reducing Terms
%%%
tag := "hash-reduce"
%%%

The {keywordOf Lean.reduceCmd}`#reduce` command repeatedly applies reductions to a term until no further reductions are possible.
Reductions are performed under binders, but to avoid unexpected slowdowns, proofs and types are skipped unless the corresponding options to {keywordOf Lean.reduceCmd}`#reduce` are enabled.
Unlike {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` command, reduction cannot have side effects and the result is displayed as a term rather than via a {name}`ToString` or {name}`Repr` instance.

Generally speaking, {keywordOf Lean.reduceCmd}`#reduce` is primarily useful for diagnosing issues with definitional equality and proof terms, while {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.eval}`#eval` is more suitable for computing the value of a term.
In particular, functions defined using {tech}[well-founded recursion] or as {tech}[partial fixpoints] are either very slow to compute with the reduction engine, or will not reduce at all.

:::syntax command (title := "Reducing Terms")
```grammar
#reduce $[(proofs := true)]? $[(types := true)]? $t
```

{includeDocstring Lean.reduceCmd}

:::

:::example "Reducing Functions"

Reducing a term results in its normal form in Lean's logic.
Because the underlying term is reduced and then displayed, there is no need for a {name}`ToString` or {name}`Repr` instance.
Functions can be displayed just as well as any other term.

In some cases, this normal form is short and resembles a term that a person might write:
```lean (name := plusOne)
#reduce (fun x => x + 1)
```
```leanOutput plusOne
fun x => x.succ
```

In other cases, the details of {ref "elab-as-course-of-values"}[the elaboration of functions] such as addition to Lean's core logic are exposed:
```lean (name := onePlus)
#reduce (fun x => 1 + x)
```
```leanOutput onePlus
fun x => (Nat.rec ⟨fun x => x, PUnit.unit⟩ (fun n n_ih => ⟨fun x => (n_ih.1 x).succ, n_ih⟩) x).1 1
```

:::

# Checking Types
%%%
tag := "hash-check"
%%%

:::syntax command (title := "Checking Types")

{keyword}`#check` can be used to elaborate a term and check its type.

```grammar
#check $t
```

If the provided term is an identifier that is the name of a global constant, then {keyword}`#check` prints its signature.
Otherwise, the term is elaborated as a Lean term and its type is printed.
:::

Elaboration of the term in {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.check}`#check` does not require that the term is fully elaborated; it may contain metavariables.
If the term as written _could_ have a type, elaboration succeeds.
If a required instance could never be synthesized, then elaboration fails; synthesis problems that are due to metavariables do not block elaboration.


:::example "{keyword}`#check` and Underdetermined Types"
In this example, the type of the list's elements is not determined, so the type contains a metavariable:
```lean (name := singletonList)
#check fun x => [x]
```
```leanOutput singletonList
fun x => [x] : ?m.9 → List ?m.9
```

In this example, both the type of the terms being added and the result type of the addition are unknown, because {name}`HAdd` allows terms of different types to be added.
Behind the scenes, a metavariable represents the unknown {name}`HAdd` instance.
```lean (name := polyPlus)
#check fun x => x + x
```
```leanOutput polyPlus
fun x => x + x : (x : ?m.12) → ?m.19 x
```

:::

:::syntax command (title := "Testing Type Errors")
```grammar
#check_failure $t
```
This variant of {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.check}`#check` elaborates the term using the same process as {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.check}`#check`.
If elaboration succeeds, it is an error; if it fails, there is no error.
The partially-elaborated term and any type information that was discovered are added to the {tech}[message log].
:::


:::example "Checking for Type Errors"

Attempting to add a string to a natural number fails, as expected:
```lean (name := oneOne)
#check_failure "one" + 1
```
```leanOutput oneOne
failed to synthesize
  HAdd String Nat ?m.32

Additional diagnostic information may be available using the `set_option diagnostics true` command.
```
Nonetheless, a partially-elaborated term is available:
```leanOutput oneOne
"one" + 1 : ?m.32
```

:::

# Synthesizing Instances
%%%
tag := "hash-synth"
%%%

:::syntax command (title := "Synthesizing Instances")
```grammar
#synth $t
```

The {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.synth}`#synth` command attempts to synthesize an instance for the provided class.
If it succeeds, then the resulting instance term is output.

:::

# Querying the Context
%%%
tag := "hash-print"
%%%

The {keyword}`#print` family of commands are used to query Lean for information about definitions.

:::syntax command (title := "Printing Definitions")
```grammar
#print $t:ident
```

Prints the definition of a constant.
:::

Printing a definition with {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.print}`#print` prints the definition as a term.
Theorems that were proved using {ref "tactics"}[tactics] may be very large when printed as terms.

:::syntax command (title := "Printing Strings")
```grammar
#print $s:str
```

Adds the string literal to Lean's {tech}[message log].
:::


:::syntax command (title := "Printing Axioms")
```grammar
#print axioms $t
```

Lists all axioms that the constant transitively relies on.
:::

:::example "Printing Axioms"

These two functions each swap the elements in a pair of bitvectors:

```lean
def swap (x y : BitVec 32) : BitVec 32 × BitVec 32 :=
  (y, x)

def swap' (x y : BitVec 32) : BitVec 32 × BitVec 32 :=
  let x := x ^^^ y
  let y := x ^^^ y
  let x := x ^^^ y
  (x, y)
```

They can be proven equal using {ref "function-extensionality"}[function extensionality], the {ref "the-simplifier"}[simplifier], and {tactic}`bv_decide`:
```lean
theorem swap_eq_swap' : swap = swap' := by
  funext x y
  simp only [swap, swap', Prod.mk.injEq]
  bv_decide
```

The resulting proof makes use of a number of axioms:
```lean (name := axioms)
#print axioms swap_eq_swap'
```
```leanOutput axioms
'swap_eq_swap'' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Lean.ofReduceBool, Quot.sound]
```
:::

:::syntax command (title := "Printing Equations")
The command {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.printEqns}`#print equations`, which can be abbreviated {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.printEqns}`#print eqns`, displays the {tech}[equational lemmas] for a function.
```grammar
#print equations $t
```
```grammar
#print eqns $t
```
:::

:::example "Printing Equations"

```lean (name := intersperse_eqns)
def intersperse (x : α) : List α → List α
  | y :: z :: zs => y :: x :: intersperse x (z :: zs)
  | xs => xs

#print equations intersperse
```
```leanOutput intersperse_eqns
equations:
@[defeq] theorem intersperse.eq_1.{u_1} : ∀ {α : Type u_1} (x y z : α) (zs : List α),
  intersperse x (y :: z :: zs) = y :: x :: intersperse x (z :: zs)
theorem intersperse.eq_2.{u_1} : ∀ {α : Type u_1} (x : α) (x_1 : List α),
  (∀ (y z : α) (zs : List α), x_1 = y :: z :: zs → False) → intersperse x x_1 = x_1
```

It does not print the defining equation, nor the unfolding equation:
```lean (name := intersperse_eq_def)
#check intersperse.eq_def
```
```leanOutput intersperse_eq_def
intersperse.eq_def.{u_1} {α : Type u_1} (x : α) (x✝ : List α) :
  intersperse x x✝ =
    match x✝ with
    | y :: z :: zs => y :: x :: intersperse x (z :: zs)
    | xs => xs
```

```lean (name := intersperse_eq_unfold)
#check intersperse.eq_unfold
```
```leanOutput intersperse_eq_unfold
intersperse.eq_unfold.{u_1} :
  @intersperse = fun {α} x x_1 =>

# Testing Output with {keyword}`#guard_msgs`
%%%
tag := "hash-guard_msgs"
%%%

The {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` command can be used to ensure that the messages output by a command are as expected.
Together with the interaction commands in this section, it can be used to construct a file that will only elaborate if the output is as expected; such a file can be used as a {tech}[test driver] in {ref "lake"}[Lake].

:::syntax command (title := "Documenting Expected Output")
```grammar
$[$_:docComment]?
#guard_msgs $[($_,*)]? in
$c:command
```

{includeDocstring Lean.guardMsgsCmd}

:::

:::example "Testing Return Values"

The {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` command can ensure that a set of test cases pass:

```lean
def reverse : List α → List α := helper []
where
  helper acc
    | [] => acc
    | x :: xs => helper (x :: acc) xs

/-- info: [] -/
#guard_msgs in
#eval reverse ([] : List Nat)

/-- info: ['c', 'b', 'a'] -/
#guard_msgs in
#eval reverse "abc".toList
```

:::


:::paragraph
The behavior of the {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` command can be specified in three ways:

 1. Providing a filter that selects a subset of messages to be checked

 2. Specifying a whitespace comparison strategy

 3. Deciding to sort messages by their content or by the order in which they were produced

These configuration options are provided in parentheses, separated by commas.
:::

::::syntax Lean.guardMsgsSpecElt (title := "Specifying {keyword}`#guard_msgs` Behavior") (open := false)

```grammar
$_:guardMsgsFilter
```
```grammar
whitespace := $_
```
```grammar
ordering := $_
```

There are three kinds of options for {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs`: filters, whitespace comparison strategies, and orderings.
::::

:::syntax Lean.guardMsgsFilter (title := "Output Filters for {keyword}`#guard_msgs`") (open := false)
```grammar
$[drop]? all
```
```grammar
$[drop]? info
```
```grammar
$[drop]? warning
```
```grammar
$[drop]? error
```

{includeDocstring Lean.guardMsgsFilter}

:::


:::syntax Lean.guardMsgsWhitespaceArg (title := "Whitespace Comparison for `#guard_msgs`") (open := false)
```grammar
exact
```
```grammar
lax
```
```grammar
normalized
```


Leading and trailing whitespace is always ignored when comparing messages. On top of that, the following settings are available:

 * `whitespace := exact` requires an exact whitespace match.

 * `whitespace := normalized` converts all newline characters to a space before matching (the default). This allows breaking long lines.

 * `whitespace := lax` collapses whitespace to a single space before matching.

:::

The option {option}`guard_msgs.diff` controls the content of the error message that {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` produces when the expected message doesn't match the produced message.
By default, {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` shows a line-by-line difference, with a leading `+` used to indicate lines from the produced message and a leading `-` used to indicate lines from the expected message.
When messages are large and only differ by a small amount, this can make it easier to notice where they differ.
Setting {option}`guard_msgs.diff` to `false` causes {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` to instead show just the produced message, which can be compared with the expected message in the source file.
This can be convenient if the difference between the message is confusing or overwhelming.

{optionDocs guard_msgs.diff}

:::example "Displaying Differences"
The {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` command can be used to test definition of a rose tree {lean}`Tree` and a function {lean}`Tree.big` that creates them:

```lean
inductive Tree (α : Type u) : Type u where
  | val : α → Tree α
  | branches : List (Tree α) → Tree α

def Tree.big (n : Nat) : Tree Nat :=
  if n = 0 then .val 0
  else if n = 1 then .branches [.big 0]
  else .branches [.big (n / 2), .big (n / 3)]
```

However, it can be difficult to spot where test failures come from when the output is large:
```lean (error := true) (name := bigMsg)
set_option guard_msgs.diff false
/--
info: Tree.branches
  [Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 2], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]]],
   Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0]]]
-/
#guard_msgs in
#eval Tree.big 20
```
The evaluation produces:
```leanOutput bigMsg (severity := information)
Tree.branches
  [Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]]],
   Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0]]]
```

Without {option}`guard_msgs.diff`, the {keywordOf Lean.guardMsgsCmd}`#guard_msgs` command reports this error:
```leanOutput bigMsg (severity := error)
❌️ Docstring on `#guard_msgs` does not match generated message:

info: Tree.branches
  [Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]]],
   Tree.branches
     [Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.branches [Tree.val 0]],
      Tree.branches [Tree.branches [Tree.val 0], Tree.val 0]]]
```

Enabling {option}`guard_msgs.diff` highlights the differences instead, making the error more apparent:
```lean (error := true) (name := bigMsg')
