The {tactic}`grind` tactic uses techniques inspired by modern SMT solvers to automatically construct proofs.
It produces proofs by incrementally collecting sets of facts, deriving new facts from the existing ones using a set of cooperating techniques.
Behind the scenes, all proofs are by contradiction, so there is no operational distinction between the expected conclusion and the premises; {tactic}`grind` always attempts to derive a contradiction.

Picture a virtual whiteboard.
Every time {tactic}`grind` discovers a new equality, inequality, or Boolean literal it writes that fact on the board, merges equivalent terms into buckets, and invites each engine to read from—and add back to—the shared whiteboard.
In particular, because all true propositions are equal to {lean}`True` and all false propositions are equal to {lean}`False`, {tactic}`grind` tracks a set of known facts as part of tracking equivalence classes.

:::paragraph
The cooperating engines are:

* {tech}[congruence closure],
* {tech}[constraint propagation],
* {tech}[E‑matching],
* guided {ref "grind-split"}[case analysis], and
* a suite of satellite theory solvers, including both {ref "cutsat"}[linear integer arithmetic] and {ref "grind-ring"}[commutative rings].

Like other tactics, {tactic}`grind` produces ordinary Lean proof terms for every fact it adds.
Lean’s standard library is already annotated with `@[grind]` attributes, so common lemmas are discovered automatically.
:::

{tactic}`grind` is *not* designed for goals whose search space explodes combinatorially—think large‑`n` pigeonhole instances, graph‑coloring reductions, high‑order N‑queens boards, or a 200‑variable Sudoku encoded as Boolean constraints.
Such encodings require thousands (or millions) of case‑splits that overwhelm {tactic}`grind`’s branching search.
For bit‑level or pure Boolean combinatorial problems, use {tactic}`bv_decide`.  The {tactic}`bv_decide` tactic calls a state‑of‑the‑art SAT solver (e.g. CaDiCaL or Kissat) and then returns a compact, machine‑checkable certificate.
All heavy search happens outside Lean; the certificate is replayed and verified inside Lean, so trust is preserved (verification time scales with certificate size).

:::TODO
Include this when it's available:
* *Full SMT problems that need substantial case analysis across multiple theories* (arrays, bit‑vectors, rich arithmetic, quantifiers, …) → use the forthcoming *`lean‑smt`* tactic—a tight Lean front‑end for CVC5 that replays unsat cores or models inside Lean.

:::example "Congruence Closure" (open := true)

This proof succeeds instantly using {tech}[congruence closure], which discovers sets of equal terms.

```lean
example (a b c : Nat) (h₁ : a = b) (h₂ : b = c) :
    a = c := by
  grind
```

:::

:::example "Algebraic Reasoning" (open := true)

This proof uses {tactic}`grind`'s commutative ring solver.

```lean
example [CommRing α] [NoNatZeroDivisors α] (a b c : α) :
    a + b + c = 3 →
    a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 = 5 →
    a ^ 3 + b ^ 3 + c ^ 3 = 7 →
    a ^ 4 + b ^ 4 = 9 - c ^ 4 := by
  grind
```
:::

:::example "Finite-Field Reasoning" (open := true)
Arithmetic operations on {name}`Fin` overflow, wrapping around to {lean type:="Fin 11"}`0` when the result would be outside the bound.
{tactic}`grind` can use this fact to prove theorems such as this:

```lean
example (x y : Fin 11) :
    x ^ 2 * y = 1 →
    x * y ^ 2 = y →
    y * x = 1 := by
  grind
```
:::

:::example "Linear Integer Arithmetic with Case Analysis" (open := true)

```lean
example (x y : Int) :
    27 ≤ 11 * x + 13 * y →
    11 * x + 13 * y ≤ 45 →
    -10 ≤ 7 * x - 9 * y →
    7 * x - 9 * y ≤ 4 →
    False := by
  grind
```

When {tactic}`grind` fails, it prints the remaining subgoal followed by all the information returned by its subsystems—the contents of the “shared whiteboard.”
In particular, it presents equivalence classes of terms that it has determined to be equal.
The two largest classes are shown as `True propositions` and `False propositions`, listing every literal currently known to be provable or refutable.
Inspect these lists to spot missing facts or contradictory assumptions.
