#doc (Manual) "Identity" =>

The identity monad {name}`Id` has no effects whatsoever.
Both {name}`Id` and the corresponding implementation of {name}`pure` are the identity function, and {name}`bind` is reversed function application.
The identity monad has two primary use cases:
 1. It can be the type of a {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Term.do}`do` block that implements a pure function with local effects.
 2. It can be placed at the bottom of a stack of monad transformers.

```lean (show := false)
-- Verify claims
example : Id = id := rfl
example : Id.run (α := α) = id := rfl
example : (pure (f := Id)) = (id : α → α) := rfl
example : (bind (m := Id)) = (fun (x : α) (f : α → Id β) => f x) := rfl
```

{docstring Id}

{docstring Id.run}

:::example "Local Effects with the Identity Monad"
This code block implements a countdown procedure by using simulated local mutability in the identity monad.
```lean (name := idDo)
#eval Id.run do
  let mut xs := []
  for x in [0:10] do
    xs := x :: xs
  pure xs
```
```leanOutput idDo
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
