Indexing a String by a String.Pos.Raw takes constant time, while character positions need to\nbe translated internally to byte positions, which takes linear time.A byte position p is valid for a string s if 0 ≤ p ≤ s.endPos and p lies on a UTF-8\ncharacter boundary, see String.Pos.IsValid.There is another type, String.ValidPos, which bundles the validity predicate. Using String.ValidPos\ninstead of String.Pos.Raw is recommended because it will lead to less error handling and fewer edge cases.Get the underlying byte index of a String.Pos.Raw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Basic Types\u0009Strings\u0009API Reference","header":"19.8.4.5.
