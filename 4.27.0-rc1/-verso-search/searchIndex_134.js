See the PR description for further details.* #7640 implements the main logic for inheriting and overriding\nautoParam fields in the structure/class commands, pending being\nenabled in the structure instance notation elaborator. Adds term info to\noverridden fields, so they now can be hovered over, and \"go to\ndefinition\" goes to the structure the field is originally defined in.* #7717 changes how {...}/where notation (\"structure instance\nnotation\") elaborates.

Instead of of many x.ctorIdx ≠ i\nhypotheses, it introduces a single Nat.hasNotBit mask x.ctorIdx\nhypothesis which compresses that information into a bitmask. This avoids\na quadratic overhead during splitter generation, where all n assumptions\nwould be refined through .subst and .cases constructions for all n\nassumption of the splitter alternative.* #11221 lets realizeConst use withDeclNameForAuxNaming so that\nauxilary definitions created there get non-clashing names.* #11222 implements elabToSyntax for creating scoped syntax s : Syntax for an arbitrary elaborator el : Option Expr -> TermElabM Expr\nsuch that elabTerm s = el.* #11236 extracts two modules from Match.MatchEqs, in preparation of\n#11220\nand to use the module system to draw clear boundaries between concerns\nhere.* #11239 adds a Unit assumption to alternatives of the splitter that\nwould otherwise not have arguments. This fixes #11211.* #11245 improves the error message encountered in the case of a type\nclass instance resolution failure, and adds an error explanation that\ndiscusses the common new-user case of binary operation overloading and\npoints to the trace.Meta.synthInstance option for advanced debugging.* #11256 replaces MatcherInfo.numAltParams with a more detailed data\nstructure that allows us, in particular, to distinguish between an\nalternative for a constructor with a Unit field and the alternative\nfor a nullary constructor, where an artificial Unit argument is\nintroduced.* #11261 continues the homogenization between matchers and splitters,\nfollowing up on #11256. In particular it removes the ambiguity whether\nnumParams includes the discrEqns or not.* #11269 adds support for decidable equality of empty lists and empty\narrays. Decidable equality for lists and arrays is suitably modified so\nthat all diamonds are definitionally equal.* #11292 adds intersection operation on\nExtDTreeMap/ExtTreeMap/ExtTreeSet and proves several lemmas about\nit.* #11301 allows setting reducibilityCoreExt in async contexts (e.g. when\nusing mkSparseCasesOn in a realizable definition)* #11302 renames the CTests tests to use filenames as test names.

Users are kindly asked to report if they rely\non these options.* #11305 removes the group field from option descriptions. It is\nunused, does not have a clear meaning and often matches the first\ncomponent of the option name.* #11307 removes all code that sets the Option.Decl.group field, which\nis unused and has no clearly documented meaning.* #11325 adds CoreM.toIO', the analogue of CoreM.toIO dropping the\nstate from the return type, and similarly for TermElabM.toIO' and\nMetaM.toIO'.* #11333 adds infrastructure for parallel execution across Lean's tactic\nmonads.* #11338 upstreams the with_weak_namespace command from Mathlib:\nwith_weak_namespace <id> <cmd> changes the current namespace to <id>\nfor the duration of executing command <cmd>, without causing scoped\nthings to go out of scope. This is in preparation for upstreaming the\nscoped[Foo.Bar] syntax from Mathlib, which will be useful now that we\nare adding grind annotations in scopes.* #11346 modifies the error message for type synthesis failure for the\ncase where the type class in question is potentially derivable using a\nderiving command. Also changes the error explanation for type class\ninstance synthesis failure with an illustration of this pattern.* #11347 adds a focused error explanation aimed at the case where someone\ntries to use Natural-Numbers-Game-style induction proofs directly in\nLean, where such proofs are not syntactically valid.* #11353 applies beta reduction to specialization keys, allowing us to\nreuse specializations in more situations.* #11379 sets @[macro_inline] on the (trivial) .ctorIdx for inductive\ntypes with one constructor, to reduce the number of symbols generated by\nthe compiler.* #11385 lets implicit instance names avoid name clashes with private\ndeclarations.

Provides a new error explanation for field notation.* #11463 fixes a panic in getEqnsFor? when called on matchers generated\nfrom match expressions in theorem types.* #11474 generalizes the noConfusion constructions to heterogeneous\nequalities (assuming propositional equalities between the indices). This\nlays ground work for better support for applying injection to\nheterogeneous equalities in grind.* #11476 adds a {givenInstance}`C` documentation role that adds an\ninstance of C to the document's local assumptions.* #11482 gives suggestions based on the currently-available constants\nwhen projecting from an unknown type.* #11485 ensures that Nats in .olean files use a deterministic\nserialization in the case where LEAN_USE_GMP is not set.* #11490 prevents try swallowing heartbeat errors from nested simp\ncalls, and more generally ensures the isRuntime flag is propagated by\nthrowNestedTacticEx. This prevents the behavior of proofs (especially\nthose using aesop) being affected by the current recursion depth or\nheartbeat limit.* #11492 uses the the helper functions withImplicitBinderInfos and\nmkArrowN in more places.* #11493 makes Match.MatchEqs a leaf module, to be less restricted in\nwhich features we can use there.* #11502 adds two benchmarks for elaborating match statements of many\nNat literals, one without and one with splitter generation.* #11508 avoids generating hyps when not needed (i.e. if there is a\ncatch-all so no completeness checking needed) during matching on values.This tweak was made possible by #11220.* #11510 avoids running substCore twice in caseValues.* #11511 implements a linter that warns when a deprecated coercion is\napplied. It also warns when the Option coercion or the\nSubarray-to-Array coercion is used in Init or Std. The linter is\ncurrently limited to Coe instances; CoeFun instances etc. are not\nconsidered.* #11518 provides an additional hint when the type of an autobound\nimplicit is required to have function type or equality type — this\nfails, and the existing error message does not address the fact that the\nsource of the error is an unknown identifier that was automatically\nbound.* #11541 adds support for underscores as digit separators in\nString.toNat?, String.toInt?, and related parsing functions. This makes\nthe string parsing functions consistent with Lean's numeric literal\nsyntax, which already supports underscores for readability (e.g.,\n100_000_000).* #11554 adds @[suggest_for] annotations to Lean, allowing lean to\nprovide corrections for .every or .some methods in place of .all\nor .any methods for most default-imported types (arrays, lists,\nstrings, substrings, and subarrays, and vectors).* #11555 scans the environment for viable replacements for a dotted\nidentifier (like .zero) and suggests concrete alternatives as\nreplacements.* #11566 lets the compiler treat per-constructor noConfusion like the\ngeneral one, and moves some more logic closer to no confusion\ngeneration.* #11571 lets whnf not consult isNoConfusion, to speed up this hot\npath a bit.* #11587 adjusts the new meta keyword of the experimental module system\nnot to imply partial for general consistency.* #11607 makes argument-less tactic invokations of Std.Do tactics such\nas mintro emit a proper error message \"mintro expects at least one\npattern\" instead of claiming that Std.Tactic.Do needs to be imported.* #11611 fixes a noConfusion compilation introduced by #11562.* #11619 allows Lean to present suggestions based on @[suggest_for]\nannotations for unknown identifiers without internal dots. (The\nannotations in #11554 only gave suggestion for dotted identifiers like\nArray.every->Array.all and not for bare identifiers like\nResult->Except or ℕ->Nat.)* #11620 ports Batteries.WF to Init.WFC for executable well-founded\nfixpoints. It introduces csimp theorems to replace the recursors and\nnon-executable definitions with executable definitions.* #11621 causes Lean to search through @[suggest_for] annotations on\ncertain errors that look like unknown identifiers that got incorrectly\nautobound. This will correctly identify that a declaration of type\nMaybe String should be Option String instead.* #11624 fixes a SIGFPE crash on x86_64 when evaluating INT_MIN / -1 or\nINT_MIN % -1 for signed integer types.* #11637 declares the module system as no longer experimental and makes\nthe experimental.module option a no-op, to be removed.* #11644 makes .ctorIdx not an abbrev; we don't want grind to unfold\nit.* #11645 fixes the docstring of propagateForallPropUp. It was\ncopy’n’pasta before.* #11652 teaches grind how to reduce .ctorIdx applied to\nconstructors. It can also handle tasks likexs ≍ Vec.cons x xs' → xs.ctorIdx = 1\nthanks to a .ctorIdx.hinj theorem (generated on demand).* #11657 improves upon #11652 by keeping the kernel-reduction-optimized\ndefinition.\n\n","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Release Notes\u0009Lean 4.27.0-rc1 (2025-12-14)","header":"Language","id":"/releases/v4.27.0/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Release-Notes--Lean-4___27___0-rc1-_LPAR_2025-12-14_RPAR_--Language"}});
