The first array contains\nthose elements for which p returns true, and the second contains those for which p returns\nfalse.as.partition p is equivalent to (as.filter p, as.filter (not ∘ p)), but it is\nmore efficient since it only has to do one pass over the array.Examples:* #[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7].partition (· > 2) = (#[5, 7, 7], #[1, 2, 2])* #[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7].partition (fun _ => false) = (#[], #[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7])* #[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7].partition (fun _ => true) = (#[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7], #[])\n\nGroups the elements of an array xs according to the function key, returning a hash map in which\neach group is associated with its key.
